The findings are intended to inform the design of a robotic controller that delivers pulses of torque to the lower extremity joints with optimal timing and amplitude to induce desirable modulations of GS and SL, and of associated spatiotemporal parameters.\nConcepts sagittal plane矢状面，把身体分成左右两条，解剖学用来描述身体各部分位置（类似经线）N.B.不只有中线\nsagittal plane movement包括任何具有前后成分的运动\nNotations GS: gait speed\nTLA: trailing limb angle\nSL: stride length\nSL for cycle k was defined based on the right heel strike time t and anteroposterior coordinate in the laboratory frame x and constant velocity of the treadmill v\n$SL_{(k)}=x_{(k+1)}-x_{(k)}+v(t_{(k+1)}-t_{(k)})$\nBackground   gait training devices\n  that promote desired changes in gait\n  Challenges in developing such devices: limited understanding of human response to robotic input\n 比如机器人运动辅助会怎样影响gait speed    Possible method of controller formulation: control robot to apply the change in joint moment applied by human subjects when they achieve a gait feature of interest.\n  However, it is currently unclear how lower extremity joint moments are modulated by even basic gait spatio-temporal parameters.\n    GS $\\leftrightarrow$ propulsive force + Propulsive impulse $\\leftrightarrow$ TLA $\\Rightarrow$ GS $\\leftrightarrow$ TLA\nGS correlated with anterior- posterior ground reaction force(the propulsive force of the foot against the ground)1\nPropulsive impulse冲量(the propulsive force integrated over time), is associated with the posture of the trailing limb at push-off.2 The posture of the trailing limb at push-off is quantified by one kinematic parameter, known as trailing limb angle (TLA), defined as the angle of the line connecting the hip joint center and foot center of pressure at the instant of peak propulsive force, relative to the global vertical axis最大推进力瞬时髋与足中心连线与竖直方向的夹角\nWhen increasing GS, the increase in TLA contributes twice as much as the increase in ankle moment to the resulting increase in propulsive force. In older adults exposed to a biofeedback paradigm for increasing propulsive force, increased TLA and decreased hip flexor power were the primary means by which they increased propulsive force.\n  A possible method of controller formulation can be derived from the principle of bio-inspiration, where a robot is controlled to apply the difference in joint moment applied by human subjects when they achieve a desired gait feature (in this case modulation of TLA), relative to their normal walking condition. 控制思路：检测TLA变化，根据正常行走时的关系调整辅助系统的关节运动\n  Since TLA has not been a primary measure ofinterest in the biome- chanics literature, we extended our search to a more common variable, likely correlated to TLA, such as stride length (SL).\n  GS modulation和magnitude of peak joint moments的关系研究得比较多，hip knee ankle和变化的先后关系、出现的phase等；However, fewer investigations have focused on the joint kinetics associated with the modulation of spatiotemporal parameters such as SL or TLA, and studied this effect at multiple GS values.又列举了一些证明SL和关节动力学有关的研究；Thus far, the factorial modulation ofboth GS and SL and resulting hip, knee, and ankle kinetics has not been investigated; as such it is unclear how lower extremity joint moments are modulated by both gait parameters.\n  Materials and Methods  准备：跑步机；36 reflective spherical markers (4 on the pelvis, 4 per thigh, 4 per shank, 2 per knee, and 6 on ankle/foot；摄像头动捕；Marker data were acquired at 100 Hz, while the treadmill analog force/torque data were acquired at 2 kHz；biofeedback 显示当前SL使被试进行调整 采样：GS 5 * SL 3 = 15种场景；  Results  gait speed has a significant effect on the moment profiles in all joints considered； stride length has more localized effects on the knee moment during stance, and smaller effects observed for the hip joint moment during swing and ankle moment during the loading response.

Walking at slower speeds (\u0026lt;60m/min) reduces the momentum, and therefore the vertical acceleration, with a corresponding decrease in both the peaks and valley deviations from body weight.\nConversely, fast walking speeds induce higher peaks and lower valleys. Running registers peaks 2.5 times body weight.\nHorizontal Shear The forces generated parallel to the wa1king surface are called shear.\nHorizontal forces in the anterior-posterior (AP) plane: the ground reaction force vector deviates from the vertical.\nHorizontal medial-lateral (ML 内侧 外侧 ) shear forces: the exchange of body weight from one limb to the\nML force is least, being less than 10% of body weight. Peak medial shear (5% BW) occurs in mid loading response. Lateral shear reaches a peak (7% BW) in terminal stance.\nThe AP shear force (also called fore-aft forces) is equivalent to less than 25%of body weight. At initial contact there often is a momentary aft shear (13% BW).\nLoadingthe limb rapidly introduces an anteriorly directed force, which reaches a peak (13% BW) at the end of the loading response phase. This is not sustained.\nMid stanceis an interval with minimal sagittal shear until just before heel rise, when a posterior shear begins. There is a rapid rise in the posterior forcethroughout terminal stance, with a final peak equaling 23%BW.\n⬆️ Normal ground reaction force pattern during stance. (a) Vertical force; (b) Lateral shear (horizontal); (c) Progressional shear (horizontal fore/aft).\nVectors Joint Torques Torque is defined as the product of the force and its lever arm T = FxL. The lever (or moment arm) for the joint torque presented by the body\u0026rsquo;s posture is the perpendicular distance between the line of action of the vector and the center of the joint. The vertical ground reaction is the determining force in stance. By combining motion and vector data the torques occurring throughout the stride can be calculated. Sagittal plane data define the flexion and extension torques. Coronal plane measurements identify the abduction and adduction demands. Transverse moments (torques) are calculated by combin­ing the fore-aft and mediolateral values. Calculation of joint torques from the vector and motion data, as just described, is technically easier, but the effects of gravity and inertia are not included. Studies comparing moment calculations with and without consider­ing the gravitational and inertial factors have shown no difference in the ankle data, but at the hip and knee there were intervals in the gait cycle where the simple vector data registered higher values The investigators have differed on the significance of these findings. Bressler and Frankel noted a brief increase in both the knee and hip values at the beginning loading response of approximately 20% and a similar difference in terminal stance for the hip. Mikosz et al noted the exaggeration of the sagittal knee and hip torques (expressed in units of percent body weight X stature) was 1 % each. These two groups of authors concluded that for most situations, use of the unmodified vector data was adequate. Wells , in contrast, felt the omission of the While very significant for understanding the logic of muscular action, the resulting numbers tend to be too abstract for most clinicians.\n自重会带来影响但部分研究人员认为可以忽略。\nCenter of Pressure C/P base of the GRF vector lies within the foot, as that is the body segment in contact with the floor.\nWhile the word pressure is in common use, it is not correct, as the area of contact is not considered in the calculation. Center of support would be more accurate.\nEach C/P point represents the mean of the vertical forces on the four instrumented supporting posts of the force plate. By also defining the location of the foot on the force plate, an anatomical correlation can be made. The center of pressure is related to the plantar outline of the foot, but its location does not necessarily identify that portion of the foot receiving the greatest pressure. Only during the period of isolated heel support in loading response or the forefoot support interval in terminal stance will the C/P have any anatomical significance. Even then, the C/ P point represents an average of all the forces on either the heel or forefoot, not the site of maximum pressure.\nThe C/P is located in an anatomical area that makes little or no contact with the floor. C/P位于一个解剖区域，很少或没有接触地板。\nIntrinsic Foot Pressure To determine the pressures experienced by the different structures within the foot\nStride Characteristics 步幅分析 The natural mix of joint mobility, muscle strength, neural control and energy leads to a customary walk­ing speed, stride length and step rate. These time and distance factors, in combination with the swing and stance times, constitute the person\u0026rsquo;s stride characteristics.\nNormal persons, while able to voluntarily modify their gait velocity as needed, also have a spontaneous rate that is called either free or customary walking speed (CWS). This free rate of travel designates the optimum functional balance of the person\u0026rsquo;s physical qualities.\nVelocity = Stride Length x 0.5 Cadence Cadence (step rate)\nNormal Variability Normal adults show a moderate variability in their free walking velocity. One group of 60 subjects ages 20 to 65 years showed a 7% standard deviation during indoor testing following pretraining to a common cadence. Another 111 persons ages 20 to 80 tested on an outdoor track displayed a 4% deviation. Two identifiable sources of this variability are age and height (or limb length). Age\n A notable difference in velocity (14%) when arthritis and other disabilities are allowed as natural events. With healthy subjects the influence of age is less, but increases as years beyond 65 are added. The decrease in mean velocity was just 3% for a 60- to 65-year-old group. This increased to 9% when the study group included ages 60 to 80; significant decline in walking ability began after age 70 years.  Limb Length 儿童中显著；成人腿长与步幅相关性不强($r^2$ = 0.21 ~ 0.28)\nVoluntary Variability Normal persons have a wide range of safe and relatively comfortable walking speeds.\nthe changes in stride length and cadence were about equal. (of similar percentage)\nThe standard deviations for normal free walking is approximately 10% of the mean value. The preceding data indicate 4% of this deviation is related to leg length. Age has no significance until the person is past 60 years. Thus, the larger factor appears to be spontaneous variability.\nEnergy Cost 能量消耗 与实验无关，暂略\n  J. Perry, J.M.

The factors can be of various types:\n Extrinsic: such as terrain, footwear, clothing, cargo Intrinsic: sex, weight, height, age, etc. Physical: such as weight, height, physique Psychological: personality type, emotions Physiological: anthropometric characteristics, i.e., measurements and proportions of body Pathological: for example trauma, neurological diseases, musculoskeletal anomalies, psychiatric disorders  Parameters 描述步态的参数 The parameters taken into account for the gait analysis are as follows:\n  Step length 步长\n  Stride length 步幅\n  Cadence 节奏(Step rate; xx steps per minute)\n  Speed\n  Dynamic base\n  Progression line 渐进线\n  Foot angle\n  Hip angle\n  Squat performance\n  gait parameters：一种分类2 Joint angles Gait events/Gait phases initial and end contact(most common) (IC) initial contact; (LR) loading response; (MS) mid stance; (TS) terminal stance; (PS) pre-swing; (EC) end contact; (SW) swing\nSpatiotemporal parameters Stride Time , Step time, Stance time, Gait velocity, Cadence, Stride symmetry\nGait Analysis: three basic approaches3 The simplest system subdivides the cycle accord­ing to the variations in reciprocal floor contact by the two feet. A second method uses the time and distance qualities of the stride. The third approach identifies the functional significance of the events within the gait cycle and designates these intervals as the functional phases of gait.\nGait cycle (GC) One gait cycle (a single sequence of these functions by one limb) can be divided into two phases, stance (ST) and swing (SW), which can be subdivided into five and three phases, respectively.\nStance is the term used to designate the entire period during which the foot is on the ground. Stance begins with initial contact.\nSwing applies to the time the foot is in the air for limb advancement. Swing begins as the foot is lifted from the floor (toe-off).\nStance is subdivided into three intervals according to the sequence of floor contact by the two feet. Both the start and end of stance involve a period of bilateral foot contact with the floor (double stance), while the middle portion of stance has one foot contact.\nInitial double stance(10%) begins the gait cycle. It is the time both feet are on the floor after initial contact. An alternate term is double limb support. This designation is to be avoided, however, as it implies an equal sharing of body weight by the two feet, which is not true during most of the double stance interval. Single limb support(40%) begins when the opposite foot is lifted for swing. In keeping with the terminology for the double contact periods, this should be (and often is) called single stance. To emphasize the functional significance of floor contact by just one foot, the term support is preferred. During the single limb support interval the body\u0026rsquo;s entire weight is resting on that one extremity. The duration of single stance is the best index of the limb\u0026rsquo;s support capability. Terminal double stance(10%) is the third subdivision. It begins with floor contact by the other foot (contralateral initial contact) and continues until the original stance limb is lifted for swing (ipsilateral toe-off). The term terminal double limb support has been avoided, as weight bearing is very asymmetrical.\n(根据两腿所在的运动相划分，与phase不同)\nGait Cycle ＆ Speed   The precise duration of these gait cycle intervals varies with the person\u0026rsquo;s walking velocity. The duration of both gait periods shows an inverse relationship to walking speed. That is, both total stance and swing times are shortened as gait velocity increases. The change in stance and swing times becomes progressively greater as speed slows.\n  Among the subdivisions of stance a different relationship exits. Walking faster proportionally lengthens single stance and shortens the two double stance intervals. The reverse is true as the person\u0026rsquo;s walking speed slows. This pattern of change also is curvilinear.\n  Having an interval when both feet are in contact with the ground for the limbs to exchange their support roles is a basic characteristic of walking. When double stance is omitted, the person has entered the running mode of locomotion.\nStride and Step Stride is the equivalent of a gait cycle. It is based on the actions of one limb.The duration of a stride is the interval between two sequential initial floor contacts by the same limb (i.e., right IC and the next right IC).\nStep refers to the timing between the two limbs. There are two steps in each stride (or gait cycle). At the midpoint of one stride the other foot contacts the ground to begin its next stance period. The interval between an initial contact by each foot is a step (i.e., left and then right). The same offset in timing will be repeated in reciprocal fashion throughout the walk.\nGait Phases The phases of gait also provide a means for correlating the simultaneous actions of the individual joints into patterns of total limb function. 联系关节模式和运动\nTasks weight acceptance (WA) Weight acceptance begins the stance period and uses the first two gait phases (initial contact and loading response).\nSingle limb support (SLS) continues stance with the next two phases of gait (mid stance and terminal stance).\nLimb advancement(LA) begins in the final phase of stance (pre-swing) and then continues through the three phases of swing (initial swing, midswing and terminal swing).\nStance ST 支撑相  首次触地期（initial contact，IC） 承重反应期（loading response，LR） 支撑相中期（mid stance, MS） 支撑相末期（terminal stance, TS） 摆动前期（pre-swing, PS）  Corresponding to the beginning of the ST phase, the initial contact (IC) describes the moment when one part of the foot, in physiologic gait the heel, touches the ground. The loading response (LR) starts with the IC and ends with the contralateral toe-off. Subsequently, the mid stance (MS) lasts until the heel-off of the reference leg. The MS is followed by the terminal stance (TS), which ends with the contralateral IC. The ST phase terminates with the pre-swing (PS), which ends with the toe-off of the reference leg. 2\nSW 摆动相  摆动相早期（initial swing，IS） 摆动相中期（mid swing，MS） 摆动相末期（terminal swing，TS）  Considering the SW phase, the initial swing follows the PS and terminates when the ankle joint of the reference leg crosses the supporting leg. This phase is followed by the mid swing, which ends with the tibia of the reference leg being vertical to the ground. The gait cycle is concluded by the terminal swing, which ends with the initial contact of the reference leg.\nBasic Functions(Locomotor Functions) 上身passenger 下面locomotor（涉及11个关节）\nAs the locomotor unit carries the body to its desired location each weight-bearing limb accomplishes four distinct functions. (1) A propulsive force is generated. (2) Upright stability is maintained, despite an ever-changing posture. (3) The shock of floor impact at the onset of each stride is minimized. (4) Energy is conserved by these functions being performed in a manner that reduces the amount of muscular effort required (Table 3.1). The accomplish­ment of each function depends on a distinct motion pattern. Each represents a complex series of interactions between the body mass and the two multiseg­mented lower limbs. During walking these blend into a single, three-dimen­sional pattern.\n主要有4个Locomotor Functions: Propulsion, Stance Stability, Shock Absorption, Energy Conservation, 不同的function对应的重心位置和关节角不同，随phase的变化也不同，详见此书3p19-p47\n  Gait analysis wikipedia\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Rafael Caldas, Marion Mundt, Wolfgang Potthast, Fernando Buarque de Lima Neto, Bernd Markert,A systematic review of gait analysis methods based on inertial sensors and adaptive algorithms,Gait \u0026amp; Posture,Volume 57,,2017\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n J.

Reliability of centre of pressure, plantar pressure, and plantar-flexion isometric strength measures: A systematic review COP PP PFisom 三种步态控制measurement 的可靠性\n方法：对三个数据库实验进行同行评估 ICC\nBackground Centre of pressure (COP), plantar pressure (PP), and plantar-flexion isometric strength (PFisom) are often examined in relation to postural control and gait.\nResearch question Our aim was to systematically review and quality appraise articles addressing the reliability of COP and PP measures in static stance and PFisom measures.\nMethods Three electronic databases **(**SCOPUS®, SportDISCUS™, and PubMed) were searched and supplemented by a manual search. Peer-reviewed original research on the reliability of COP, PP, and PFisom in healthy adults (≥18 years) was included. Quality appraisal was done according to the updated COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments reliability checklist. Data regarding study characteristics, test protocols, outcome measures, and reliability metrics were extracted.\nResults Forty articles met inclusion and were assessed for their methodological quality. Only four articles (10%) obtained uppermost quality scores. From the reviewed studies, the most reliable measures were: COP sway area and path length; PP mean pressure, percentage body weight distribution, and contact area; and PFisom peak torque and force. Although these measures generally exhibited good-to-excellent relative reliability based on correlation coefficients, absolute reliability based on typical errors were not always optimal (variation \u0026gt; 10%). Literature on PP reliability was scarce (n = 2).\n2.Assessment of spatio-temporal gait parameters from trunk accelerations during human walking 基于加速度预测时空上的步态参数的可行性 spatio-temporal gait parameters\nIntro Basic prerequisites for gait analysis are the assessment of spatio-temporal gait parameters and the analysis of movements within subsequent stride cycles. 后续步幅周期内运动\nAs a matter of convention, the stride cycle is defined as the interval between two subsequent right foot contacts. Hence, the stride starts with a left step, which is followed by a right step.\nSome typical examples are the use of conducting foot switches [1], pressure-sensitive foot switches [2], [3], [4], ground reaction forces (GRFs) [5], [6], or the analysis of foot displacement patterns [7], [8]. // 用其他装置测量其他信号\nAlthough already in the 1970s the use of accelerometers for an analysis of human movement was suggested [9], it is only recently that a number of studies have reported gait analyses based upon the use of accelerometers on trunk, thigh, shank or foot (for examples see Refs. [10], [11], [12]). Only few studies have addressed the relationships between measured accelerations and spatio-temporal gait parameters. Using neural networks, the speed and distance of walking can be estimated [13]. //加速度与运动关联的提出 一些相关实验\nAverage temporal characteristics like step or stride duration can be estimated from acceleration data (for example, by means of cross correlation functions or frequency analysis).\nfeasibility\n A study by Zijlstra and Hof [16] demonstrated that three-dimensional (3D) displacements of the lower trunk during walking are predicted well by an inverted pendulum model（倒立摆模型） of the body\u0026rsquo;s centre of mass (CoM) trajectory. In agreement with model predictions, the amplitude and timing of pelvic displacements depended on spatio-temporal parameters of the stride cycle. The inverted pendulum model also predicts a basic pattern of lower trunk acceleration during walking, and relationships between acceleration characteristics and spatio-temporal gait parameters. Hence, spatio-temporal gait parameters can possibly be determined from accelerations of the lower trunk. //倒立摆模型说明加速度和步态的时空参数有关联性  主要工作\n Therefore, the present paper investigates the feasibility of an analysis of spatio-temporal gait parameters based upon accelerometry. Specifically, it analyses the 3D-acceleration pattern of the lower trunk at different walking speeds, and it evaluates algorithms that were developed to determine the instant of foot contacts, to identify left and right foot contacts, and to estimate mean step length and walking speed.  Method step length = $2\\sqrt{2lh-h^2}$ //h重心偏移（本文中 向上加速度二重积分） l摆线长（腿长）\nTo avoid integration drift, position data were high-pass filtered (fourth-order zero-lag Butterworth filter at 0.1 Hz).\nFrom the same 20 steps, mean step duration was calculated. For each subject and each belt speed condition, mean step length divided by mean step duration was used to estimate walking speed.\nResult Accelerations of the lower trunk during treadmill walking Vertical accelerations are adjusted by subtracting the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/ s2). Solid lines represent mean patterns, and dashed lines represent +- 1 S.D. （标准差）The stride cycle starts (0%) and ends (100%) with a right foot contact, left foot contact is at 50%.\nCloser inspection of these acceleration signals in relation to the GRF data showed that the timing of an additional peak or indention corresponded to the beginning or end of swing phases, respectively. In the mean data presented in Fig. 1, such an indention can be observed just preceding the peak acceleration at 50% of the stride cycle. The indention preceding foot contact could cause a short period of negative values in forward acceleration.附加峰值或凹陷的时间分别对应于摆动阶段的开始或结束。在图1中所示的平均数据中，可以观察到这种锯齿状刚好出现在步幅周期50%的峰值加速度之前。\nFoot contact detection and duration of the stride cycle Data traces represent a sample of the data of a male subject walking at a treadmill speed of 1.25 m/s.\nThe upper figure shows antero-posterior acceleration data as a solid grey line.\nThe lower figure shows right and left vertical GRFs (L/R-GRFs) divided by body weight (BW). Right GRFs are shown as a solid black line, and left GRFs as a dashed line. Arrows in the lower figure indicate the starts (and ends) of stride cycles, as identified by right GRFs.\nArrows in the lower figure indicate the starts (and ends) of stride cycles, as identified by right GRFs. In both figures, asterisks indicate the instant of foot contact as detected from left or right GRFs. Foot contacts detected from acceleration data are indicated in the upper figure by downward slopes of the block signal shown in black (zero-crossing method), and the open circles around peak acceleration values (peak detection method).\nDiscrimination between left and right steps 3.An evaluation of measurement systems estimating gait speed during a loaded military march over graded terrain Gait speed can be estimated using a single IMU (located at wrist or arm pit).\nCorrecting for confounders such as body size, load and shoe type is necessary.\nUphill and downhill walking both change gait parameters and walk ratio.\nThe change in walk ratio causes an overestimation of the gait speed.\nAltimetry should be used to correct the estimation of gait speed in graded terrain.\nMethods Data processing EQ-02 data was processed using Matlab (R2017a, The Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA). A custom-made algorithm using peak detection functions was used to calculate the number of steps and counts (total and separate for the sagittal plane) from raw accelerometer output for each 200 m trial, and the trial time was derived from the EQ-02. From these parameters speed, cadence and counts per second were calculated.\nNLD模型 $$ Walking speed [m/s] = 0.301*(step/s)2 + 0.011*counts/s \\+ 0.687*height [m]− 0.003*body\\ weight[kg] \\+ 0.040*footwear_type [0\\ for\\ running\\ shoes,\\ 1\\ for\\ combat\\ boots] − 0.958 $$\n$ (n = 266; R^2 = 0.968; R^2_{adjusted}= 0.968; \\text{standard error of the estimate} = 0.082 m/s)$\n$$ Running speed [m/s] = 0.183*(step/s)2 + 0.028*counts/s \\− 0.228*footwear_type \\text{[0 for running shoes, 1 for combat boots]} \\+ 0.017*counts_{sagitalplane}/s – 1.226 $$ (n = 160; R2 = 0.746; R2adjusted = 0.740; standard error of the estimate = 0.325 m s−1)\n地形（上下坡）对步态的影响 数据校正(body size，负载和鞋子类型等)\n女性的步伐比男性慢，步幅较小，步频更快[ [21]，[22]，[23] ]。这些性别差异仅归因于身高的不同，例如身高和体重[ [22]，[24] ]。身高和腿长与首选的步行速度和步幅呈正相关，但体重和体重指数对步态参数没有影响[ 25 ]。\n坡度影响 在以前的研究中，受试者可以自由选择他们的步行速度，上坡步行导致速度，步长和步频降低[ [23]，[26] ]。这些发现与本研究2的结果相符，在本研究中，发现与水平行走相比，在6.5％的坡度上进行上坡行走时行走速度降低（从1.47降至1.22 m s -1）。这种下降是由较低的节奏和较小的步长引起的。此外，观察到水平步行和上坡步行之间的步行比率变化，导致两种算法的步行速度都被高估。在较早的研究中，下坡步行导致步长减少[ [17]，[23]，[26]，[27]]。节奏略有增加[ 17 ]或没有改变[ 23 ]。在研究2中，士兵们沿着5.5％的坡度行走。与水平步行相比，步行速度相同，步频更高，步长更短。步行率也发生了变化，导致两个模型的步行速度都被高估。\nTo mitigate the errors caused by walking uphill or downhill, a correction for grade should be implemented. This could be achieved by using barometer data to estimate the grade [28] or by using IMUs on the foot/shoe to estimate inclination for each step [19]. Given the location of the sensors, the algorithms discussed in this paper could be corrected using a barometer.\n-1.Others 特征工程参考 Machine learning algorithms can classify outdoor terrain types during running using accelerometry data 无关变量的影响 Detection of age and gender differences in walking using mobile wearable sensors 使用移动可穿戴传感器检测步行中的年龄和性别差异\nConclusion An interaction was present between gender and age group (p = 0.034) with the older females being younger than the older males (Female: 66.21 ± 5.29, Male: 71.00 ± 5.64) while there was no gender difference in age for the younger group (Female: 22.89 ± 3.14, Male: 21.64 ± 2.62).
