As shown in Figure 7F, the force generated from proposed SR brace in radial/ulnar deviation was around 6 N; thus, considering the length of the 2-actuator unit of 128 mm, the torque generated by the SR brace reached up to 0.76 Nm, which is about 58% of the max torque of human wrist.\nModeling and Analysis of a High-Displacement Pneumatic Artificial Muscle With Integrated Sensing         A Soft Inflatable Wearable Robot for Hip Abductor Assistance: Design and Preliminary Assessment Actuation principles; A) a schematic figure of the hip abduction actuator (HAA).

While some authors concluded that F-Scan demonstrated good to excellent reliability in measuring plantar pressures [11], others concluded that the system was not entirely suitable for accurate and repeatable absolute pressure measurements [12], [13], [14] or that the system could be used only in a sample large enough as to allow the detection of the real effect of the treatment [15]. Other studies suggested that errors could be greatly minimized by adequate preparation and use of the system [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. These and similar studies show that the system could provide valuable information but care should be taken when measuring absolute values of force or pressure.\n[16], [17]建议subject先走10min保证温度+适应，所以可以先穿上鞋再贴IMU\nMethods \u0026amp; Results KT 10N threshold\nFD\n$\\text{force threshold}= \\text{minimum}+(\\text{maximum}-\\text{minimum})\\times \\frac{10}{100}$\n​AD\n$\\text {area threshold}=\\mathrm{ALS} \\mathrm{w}+(\\mathrm{ALSt}-\\mathrm{ALSw}) \\times \\frac{5}{100}$​​\n统计load area，出现频率最高的小面积($\u0026lt; 2000 \\text{mm}^2$​)就是$\\text{area loaded during swing (ALSw)}$​，($\u0026gt;2000 \\text{mm}^2$​​) 的up to the maximum area (b) was used to find the $\\text{area loaded during stance (ALSt)}$\n5 set by visually inspecting\nstatistical analysis\nA 2 (insoles sets: 1 and 2) × 2 (time differences with respect to the gold standard for methods FD and AD) mixed design analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the analysis, with time differences serving as the within subjects factor.\n  The results of the statistical test for IC showed that there was a significant effect for the methods factor, F (1, 8) = 348.5, p \u0026lt; 0.01. The effect of the insoles sets was not significant, F (1, 8) = 0.35, p \u0026gt; 0.05, and the interaction of insoles sets and methods was also not significant, F (1, 8) = 5.1, p \u0026gt; 0.05.\nFor FO, the statistical test also showed a significant effect for the detection methods, F (1, 8) = 600.2, p \u0026lt; 0.01. The effect of the insoles sets was not significant, F (1, 8) = 0.77, p \u0026gt; 0.05, and the interaction of insoles sets and methods was also not significant, F (1, 8) = 11.1, p \u0026gt; 0.05.\n KT的阈值选取 直接用阈值最好是使用测力板\u0026quot;gold standards\u0026quot;，但也可以用insole pressure sensor1\n IPSs are often considered as an alternative to force plates in validation studies due to several advantages including cost factor, wearability, and unconstrained movement that allows natural gait in both indoor and outdoor environments.\nDespite these advantages, there are some constraints to consider. IPSs are typically placed inside the shoe and are thus subject to pressure between it and the foot, which can lead to non-zero pressure readings even when the foot is in swing phase. Although IPSs are comparable to force plates when it comes to estimation of temporal features, using them for real-time ground reaction force estimation is not recommended since it takes a considerably longer time to reach the set value compared to a force plate.\n  Different thresholds algorithms proposed: a fixed threshold for both events of zero [24], 2.5 N [25] and 10 N [8], [9], [26], a combination of 10 N for IC and 5 N for FO [10], [27], a proportion of body weight [28] or a threshold equal to two standard deviations above the mean unloaded baseline [7].

In addition, wildcard symbols, such as hyphens or inverted commas, were used to consider all possible variations of root words.\n  To avoid missing some important studies, a cross referencing was applied from each article found during electronic search. A literature search was performed by Taborri.\n  Inclusion Criteria\n Articles obtained thorough these searches were evaluated using the title and abstract. The articles were included in this systematic review when they met the following criteria: (i) they were written in English; (ii) they were published from January 2000 to September 2015. We excluded conference proceedings when a journal article published by the same authors with the same contents was already included.  Data Extraction\n Publications included in this systematic review were downloaded into Mendeley for screening. In order to make the review readable and focused on the authors’ intention, as claimed in the Introduction section, a data extraction was conducted based on major themes: (i) the granularity of the gait cycle ; (ii) sensor placement; and, (iii) method and performance of gait phase classifications.  Quality Assessment\n A quality assessment of the found articles was provided in addition to the systematic review; in particular, publications were subject to seven criteria, as shown in Table 1, in accordance to Campos and colleagues [84]. Independently, Taborri, Palermo and Rossi used the seven criteria to assess the quality of the publications. Any discrepancy among two reports was adjudicated by the third one.   gait event detection 检索关键词: gait event detection，限定2015及以后123456\nWearable sensor-based real-time gait detection: A systematic review Rueterbories et al.

The user clicks the Start button, and a timer appears in the calibration window. After a second or two, the computer directs the subject to rapidly shift their weight onto the foot to be calibrated and keep their weight applied for five to ten seconds.\nIt is important that the subject be “steady” during the calibration process. For example, the subject should be encouraged to touch a vertical surface at about the height of their ear with a finger or two. In many labs there is a wall or pillar that provides a good vertical surface. This steadies the subject without changing the vertical force. If the subject wobbles or shifts their weight on the calibration foot, the computer will reject the trial and provide a message to the user.\nFor most research, Step calibration is expected to be the most accurate technique. Step calibration has both a factor for rapid dynamic changes and compensates for time related changes in sensor output.\nVerify your calibration(Point/Step) Have your subject walk in place for a few steps while you take a recording. Select Show Panes and select New Graph. The force curves for each window should be roughly the same amplitude and duration.

Introduction   一些商用外骨骼\nExoskeleton robots require the human interface to provide walking stability so that it may function as a flexible assistant. Such robots have been developed by commercial companies including Rewalk (Talaty et al., 2013), Ekso Bionics (Baunsgaard et al., 2018), Ailegs (Chen et al., 2018), and MaiBu BEAR H1. Exoskeleton robots especially require the walking stability as far as possible so as to provide flexible assistant. The Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) (Shimizu et al., 2019), which takes advantage of sEMG in control strategy, was designed by the robotics company Cyberdyne (Yilmaz et al., 2018).\n  研究机构和大学的外骨骼\nSogang University in Korea developed a exoskeleton namely SUBAR (Chen et al., 2013; Hwang and Jeon, 2018), which could estimate the muscular torque of its wearer. Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University (Mertz, 2012) and Harvard University (Abe et al., 2018) have also made solid progress in the development of assisted exoskeletons. The Chinese University of Science and Technology designed an exoskeleton robot driven by a servo motor (Li et al., 2019) and developed a fuzzy algorithm for lower extremity exoskeleton (Huang et al., 2016a). The exoskeleton team of H. C. from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China have developed exoskeletons for paraplegia (Huang et al., 2018), hemiplegia patients (Peng et al., 2020), and human-power augmentation (Huang et al., 2016b, 2019). The exoskeleton group at the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed the fourth generation of the SIAT exoskeleton robot. With four degrees of freedom (DoFs), this exoskeleton robot has successfully enabled persons with disabilities to stand up and walk independently (Liu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018a).\n  While investigating the existing exoskeleton control methods, we found very few studies that have examined the minimum force requirements into the control scheme by the wearer. We also found scarce consideration for the state of the wearer while operating a lower limb exoskeleton.\n  Methods Gait Planning We initially treat these two joints as two points and draw the trajectories of these points during the walking process to determine the trajectory approximating the sine function (Chen et al., 2019)\nMotion Intention Recognition Muscle Fatigue Estimation the wavelet packet energy entropy (WPEE)\nResults Thoughts/Comments 这个虽然用到了COP/ZMP，但是因为是康复外骨骼有俩拐杖应该不能直接用它这个公式，但是计算方法可以看一下\n这通篇读下来也没看出来哪里control了啊，就三个模式检测出来直接上对应的机器状态，不愧是康复型\n","date":"2021-07-08T14:29:01+08:00","permalink":"https://K7288.github.io/posts/a-real-time-stability-control-method-through-semg-interface-for-lower-extremity-rehabilitation-exoskeletons/","title":"A Real-Time Stability Control Method Through sEMG Interface for Lower Extremity Rehabilitation Exoskeletons"},{"content":"A novel motion intention recognition approach for soft exoskeleton via IMU\nintention定义: the classic five kinds of terrains(including walking on flat ground, going up and downstairs, and up and down slopes) \u0026amp; transformed terrains\n   Abbreviation Definition Abbreviation Definition     IMU Inertial measurement unit SA Stair ascent   DDLMI DNN-based deep locomotion mode identification SD Stair decent   ISR Identification success rate RA Ramp ascent   LW Level-ground walking RD Ramp decent    Research question to propose a recognition method with historical information based on neural network to recognize different terrain and add the pattern transformation recognition, trying to predict the next motion mode in advance.\nIntroduction   前人的一些工作\nThe recognition of locomotion patterns in different terrains is a base for soft exoskeleton to achieve precise control. Several motion recognition methods have been proposed for different types of signals [6]. Electromyography (EMG) is one of the most important signals in motor pattern recognition [6,7]. Based on the EMG signal controller, Michael et al. [8] proposed a recognition method for walking on flat ground, ramps up and downhill. Joshi et al. [6] present a classification method to recognize walking on ground, ascending stairs and the transition between these motions using the spectrogram of EMG signal. Another accessible signal is ground reaction force (GRF), usually collected by a plantar pressure sensor on insole [9–11]. Duc Nguyen et al. [12] extracted plantar pressure data as input features, and proposed five classical motion pattern recognition methods by using the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification method. Chen et al. [13] identified different motion patterns through wearable capacitance sensors without requiring real-time gait conversion. Li et al. [14] used the threshold method based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) to identify horizontal ground, staircase rise/fall and slope rise/fall, which required only a few sensors and low computation. However, there is a phase delay in the transition to identification. Multi-sensor fusion, which is able to enhance system performance and robustness, has been widely used in recent years [15–17]. In [18], a neural muscle mechanical fusion motion pattern recognition algorithm combining EMG and GRF is proposed, which involves installing seven or more electrodes in the extremities and an insole with a pressure sensor at the foot of a healthy limb. Ma et al. [19] proposed a kernel recursive least-squares method (KRLS) to show the model generalization abilities. \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\n  其他sensor的缺点\n EMG is often used to recognize biological signals of motion patterns. However, the electrode of the EMG signal must stick to the surface of the human skin. Once the human body perspires, the wire will fall off, which brings a lot of trouble to practical application [22]. GRF is ineffective on uneven ground where the swing phase and the pressure sensor are not in full contact, even though it is readily available.    The Structure of Exoskeleton and Analysis of Motion Characteristics Methods Gait Data Process   mean filter with a window length of three $$ \\begin{cases}\\begin{array}{l} \\theta_{i}(t-j)^{\\prime}=\\frac{1}{3} \\Sigma_{1}^{-1} \\theta_{i}(t-j),\\\\ a_{i}(t-j)^{\\prime}=\\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{1}^{-1} a_{i}(t-j), i=\\{r h,l h, r k, l k\\}\\\\w_{i}(t-j)^{\\prime}=\\frac{1}{3} \\Sigma_{1}^{-1} w_{i}(t-j)\\end{array}\\end{cases} $$ where $ \\theta $ is the joint angle at time t before filtering and $ \\theta^{\\prime} $ is the corresponding joint angle after filtering. In the same way, $ a, a^{\\prime}, w, w^{\\prime} $. Here, $ i $ denotes one of the six joints, and $ j $ is the tag of a window.\nTherefore, the characteristics of the DDLMI model are characterized according to Equation (2):\n$x=[\\theta_{i}, a_{i}, w_{i}]^{T}, i=\\{r h, l h, r k, l k\\}\\Rightarrow$ input: joint angle, angular acceleration and angular velocity(an axis angle (x), two axes (XY) acceleration and two axes (YZ) angular velocity)\n  max-min normalization\nstandardize the input vector elements to the range of [−1, 1]\n  a sliding window\nEach window sequence is a training sample.

Therefore, 90 degrees should be subtracted from the original angle information when compared with the attitude angle obtained by Vicon system dynamic capture in [25]. One-way ANOVA showed that there was no significant difference in F value at the level of a = 0.01. Therefore, the inertial measurement system used in this paper is reliable.\n  也用到了滑窗法增强数据\n  ","date":"2021-07-08T09:05:01+08:00","permalink":"https://K7288.github.io/posts/a-novel-motion-intention-recognition-approach-for-soft-exoskeleton-via-imu/","title":"A novel motion intention recognition approach for soft exoskeleton via IMU"},{"content":"Daily Locomotion Recognition and Prediction: A Kinematic Data-Based Machine Learning Approach\nintention定义: locomotion modes (LMs; walking direction, level-ground walking, ascend and descend stairs, and ascend and descend ramps) and respective locomotion mode transitions(LMTs).\nResearch question to propose an automatic, user-independent recognition and prediction tool using easily wearable kinematic motion sensors for innovatively classifying several LMs (walking direction, level-ground walking, ascend and descend stairs, and ascend and descend ramps) and respective LMTs.\nIntroduction  EMG的一些drawback 之前的一些人的分类工作 它说预测的少，而且很少有达到“预”测 一些工作规定被试用a predefined limb进行transition a set of challenges 总之就是说这个工作前面做的人少而且有challenges并且没人只用kinematic data  Methods Sensors: 7 IMUs\n 数据滤波: 1st order low- pass filter (exponential smoothing) with 0.5 as the smoothing factor and a cut-off of 10 Hz [13]. 一阶低通滤波器(指数平滑)，平滑因子为0.5，截止频率为10hz  feature calculation  feature是一个窗口的；也探究window size的影响 feature两腿都有；两种方式：左腿右腿；前腿后腿the leading and opposite legs  pre-processing  normalization: compared different normalization techniques, namely centering, z-score standardization, and min-max scaling filter feature selection: minimum-redundancy maximum-relevancy (mRMR) algorithm to rank features in descending order according to their relevance [19].

An inherent disadvantage of pattern recognition-based intent recognition systems is that a considerable amount of training data must be collected. previous able-bodied gait studies with accelerometer data: by pooling data from a large subject group(e.g. n = 52), high accuracies (~96% ) of gait mode identification for a novel subject can be obtained for level-ground walking, slopes, and stairs. In addition, to obtain these high accuracies for novel subjects, group gait features were normalized to the novel subject’s level-ground walking data.  Methods   Experimental testing factors\n  training and testing: A group of eight transfemoral amputees walked over different terrains using a powered knee and ankle prosthesis. We created a pooled classifier using data from all subjects except one: data from this single subject was withheld from the pool and used to test how well the pooled classifier generalized to that subject in an offline analysis.\n  the partially-dependent classification system: including data from some of the novel subject’s steady-state level-ground walking in the training pool, to determine whether generalization to that subject improved.\n  mode-specific: having a separate classifier active for each locomotion mode. The previous locomotion mode determines the classifier model used for predicting the next stop. Each “mode specific” classifier was trained using the steady-state locomotion mode, and only the relevant transitions leaving the current locomotion mode. This enabled each transition to be statistically classified as a separate class, and to only be considered at the appropriate times.\n  DBN: dynamic Bayesian network\n  LDA: linear discriminant analysis (LDA)\n     Experimental Protocol Signal Processing  Sensors: potentiometers and encoders at the knee and ankle, an axial load cell, and a six-axis IMU on the shank; Sensor signals were generated for knee and ankle positions, velocity and torque, axial force, and shank three-directional accelerations and rotational velocities. normalization; 数据迁移到另一侧截肢的被试 划窗 segmented into analysis windows of 300ms at eight different points for each stride 特征提取 From each analysis window, six features were extracted: the signal mean and standard deviation, the minimum and maximum signal values over the window, and the starting and ending signal values   Signal Classification Strategies  Baseline Configuration: LDA Time History Configuration: DBN to integrate information over the gait cycle to include time history (TH) information.

Losey et al. provided a unifying view of human and robot sharing task execution. They defined three key themes that emerge in shared control scenarios, namely, intent detection, arbitration, and feedback [9].\n  Definition of intent in this paper: In many physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) applications, the intent can be defined in a binary way. It is often ascertained from a brain-machine interface (BMI), as seen in[10]. In other applications, user intent is defined in terms of a velocity or position trajectory, the predicted forward path of the user and/or robot.\n  human intention recognition based on myographic signals 肌电信号\n  pattern recognition\nThe pattern recognition approach is to map patterns of any number of signal features to desired prosthesis poses, grasps, or functions. The way in which control algorithms learn this mapping varies, but common approaches are LDA, SVMs, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) [11, 12, 15].\n  mapping to continuous effort.\ncontrol systems that learn the mapping between EMG signals and user’s desired joint torque, e.g. relationship between the root-mean square (RMS) of measured EMG signals and the estimated user’s desired torques [16].\n    human intention recognition based on interaction force\n dynamics model  Pehlivanet al. use an inverse dynamics model of the robot to estimate the user force applied to the robot from the robot encoder measurements [17]. In [20–22], human intentions are predicted by establishing a dynamic model of collaborator. Passenberg C. uses human models and jerk models to recognize human intention with extended Kalman filtering method [23]. These estimation methods based on the human body model are very difficult because the impedance parameters of the human body are variable and can be hardly obtained [24].   NN method  the motion intention of the human partner is defined as the desired trajectory in the employed human limb model; difficult to obtain in practice.   Hidden Markov Model  very complex and difficult to establish a model of intention recognition. C. Lee uses the Baum-Welch algorithm to train Hidden Markov Model, which predicts the collaborator\u0026rsquo;s intention by learning the meaning of the collaborators’ gestures. However, this method does not really realize the purpose of identifying partner intention [19].   In addition, the measured interaction force can be used to estimate other forms of motion intention.

Gonzalez, Richard E. Woods, 3rd Edition\n\r第一章 数字图像的采集方式以及特性 1.1 图像概述 图像是一个二维亮度函数；\n模拟图像：一幅活动、彩色、立体的图像——$I=f(x,y,z,λ,t)$，三维空间+波谱上+时间上连续，想象中的虚拟图像\n数字图像：数字图像是由模拟图象数字化得到的，以像素为基本元素、可以用数字计算机或数字电路存储和处理的图像。\n把一幅图画分割成如图所示的一个个小区域（像素），并将各小区域灰度用整数来表示，形成一幅点阵式的数字图像。它包括采样和量化两个过程。像素的位置和灰度就是像素的属性。\n图像数字化 图像数字化:将模拟图像经过离散化之后，得到用数字表示的图像。\n一幅模拟图像的坐标及幅度都是连续的，为了把它转换为数字形式，必须对坐标和幅度都作离散化操作。数字化坐标值称为采样，它确定了图像的空间分辨率；数字化幅度值称为量化，它确定了图像的幅度分辨率。\n1.2.1图像数字化——采样 （1）图像的采样：将在空间上连续的图像转换成离散的采样点（即像素）集的操作\nz=f(x,y), x∈[0,a], y∈[0,b], z∈[0,c] $\\rightarrow$ z=f(x,y), x=0,1,…,N-1,y=0,1,…,M-1, z=0,1,…,L-1\n采样间隔太小，则增大数据量；太大，则会发生信息的混叠，导致细节无法辨认。\n一维连续信号的采样 在工程中的许多信号，实际上都是连续信号，或者称为连续时间函数，记为x(t)，t的取值是从$-\\infty$ 连续变化到$+ \\infty $ 。但是，用计算机处理这些信号，必须首先对连续信号进行采样，即按一定的时间间隔Ts进行取值： $$ 𝑥_𝑑 (𝑛)=𝑥(𝑛𝑇_𝑠) , 𝑛=…−1,0,1… $$ $T_s$为采样间隔，$ x_d (n)$为离散信号或时间序列\n连续信号x(t)和频谱X(f)的具体关系为： $$ X(f)=\\int _{−\\infty}^\\infty x(t)e^{−j2\\pi ft} dt\\\\\\\\x(t)=\\int _{−\\infty}^\\infty X(f)e^{j2\\pi ft} df $$\n一维空间采样的Nyquist条件：$X(f)$有截频$ f_c$，即当$|f|≥ f_c$时, $X(f)=0$；$T_s≤\\frac{1}{2f_c}$ 或$2f_c≤f_s$\n如果信号不是有限带宽信号，采样频率或采样间隔不满足Nyquist条件，就会产生混叠现象。\n在满足Nyquist条件下，从离散信号$x(nT_s)$可恢复连续信号$x(t)$ $$ x(t)=\\Sigma_{n=−\\infty}^{+\\infty}x(nT_s)sinc(\\frac{\\pi}{T_s} (t-nT_s)) $$\n$sinc(x)=\\frac{sinx}{x}$二维连续图像信号的采样 设图像f(x,y)是一连续二维信号，其空间频谱$F(f_x,f_y )$在x方向具有截止频率$f_xc$ ，在y方向具有截止频率$f_yc$ 。所谓采样是对f(x,y)乘以空间采样函数： $$ s(x,y)=\\Sigma_{i=−\\infty }^{+\\infty }∑_{j=−\\infty }^{+\\infty }\\delta(x−i\\Delta x,y−i\\Delta y) $$ 式中Δx和Δy为x、y两个方向的采样间隔，上式为脉冲函数δ(x,y)沿x、y两个方向的展开。\n//脉冲函数：经过采样以后所得的信号为： $$ f_s (x,y)=f(x,y)∙ s(x,y)\\\\=∑_{i=−\\infty }^{+\\infty }∑_{j=−\\infty }^{+\\infty }f(i\\Delta x,j\\Delta y)\\sigma(x−i\\Delta x,y−j\\Delta y) $$\n二维Nyquist条件 为使采样以后的信号$f_s (x,y)$能完全恢复原来连续信号f(x,y) ，采样间隔Δx和Δy就必须满足$∆x≤1/(2f_{xc} ) ,∆y≤1/(2f_{yc})$，即在x和y方向的采样频率必须大于图像在x和y方向最高频率的两倍\n二维信号重建\n亚采样 （1）降低采样频率\n（2）将按采样定理获得的图像再抽样，即每隔K个像素，保留1个像素，其余的丢掉，重构时用内插法恢复丢失的数据。256×256每隔2个像素，保留1个像素-\u0026gt;128×128\n1.2.2图像数字化——量化 L在3bit以下的量化，会出现伪轮廓现象（画面平场区域出现明显的类似于等高线的不连续过渡带，从而对于画面感观质量造成影响的现象）。\n均匀量化：简单地在灰度范围内等间隔量化。\n非均匀量化：对像素出现频度少的部分量化间隔取大，而对频度大的量化间隔取小。\n1.3 数字图像基本要素 1.3.1基本要素 像素是数字图像最小的单位\n图像尺寸——一幅数字图像矩阵的大小\n像素坐标系——对图像分布进行二维空间采样\n像数值—对单个像素灰度值进行数字化采样（k bits/pixel）\n1.3.2图像质量 灰度：表示图像像素明暗程度的数值\n灰度级——表明图象中不同灰度的最大数量\n对比度=最大灰度值/最小灰度值 ——反映一幅图像中灰度方差的大小\n1.3.3图像颜色：红、绿、蓝三基色 1.3.4图像的描述：灰度/黑白/彩色图像、链表、拓扑结构、距离 灰度图像\n 图像中每个像素的信息由一个量化的灰度级来描述，没有彩色信息。 当一幅图像有2k灰度级时，通常称该图像是k比特图像。 灰度图像像素的灰度级通常为8 Bits，即0~255。“0”表示纯黑色，“255”表示纯白色。  黑白图像（二值图像）\n 像素值为0、1。二值图像通常用于文字、线条图的扫描识别(OCR)和掩模图像的存储。  彩色图像\n 三维矩阵，可用M×N×3表示，M、N分别表示图像的行、列数，三个M×N的二维矩阵分别表示各个像素的R、G、B三个颜色分量。每个颜色分量的数据类型一般为8位无符号整型。  链表—描述目标物体的边界\n拓扑结构——描述一组图形及其相互关系\n距离—描述图像中像素之间的接近程度\n欧氏、曼哈顿（城区）（坐标差绝对值相加）、棋盘（坐标差绝对值最大的那个）\n1.3.5图像的矩阵特性：距离、邻域、临接、连通 邻域—描述与像素相邻的其他像素\n邻接\n像素间邻接的两个必要条件：①一个像素在另一个像素的邻域中；②两个像素的灰度值满足特定的相似准则。\n令V表示关于邻接的灰度值集合(相似准则)。\n①4-邻接 像素p和q的灰度值都属于V，且q在p的4-邻域集合**$N_4(p)$**中，则称像素*p*和*q*是4-邻接的。\n②8-邻接 像素p和q的灰度值都属于V，且q在集合$N_8(p)$中，则称像素p和q是8-邻接的。\n③m-邻接 像素p和q的灰度值都属于V，若满足下列条件之一：\n•q在集合$N_4(p)$中；\n•q在集合$N_D(p)$中（对角邻域）,且集合$N_4(p)\\cap N_4(q)$中的像素的灰度值不属于V。\n则称像素p和q是m-邻接的。\n像素间的通路\n从坐标为$(x_0,y_0 )$的像素p到坐标为$(x_n,y_n )$的像素q的一条通路由像素序列组成对应坐标序列为:\n$ (x_0,y_0 ) ,(x_1,y_1 ), ⋯,(x_i,y_i ) ⋯,(x_n,y_n ) $，这里$(x_i,y_i )$与$(x_{i-1},y_{i-1} )$相邻接，n为通路长度。\n若$(x_0,y_0 )=(x_n,y_n )$则该通路是闭合通路。根据不同的邻接类型，可以得到不同的通路，如4-通路，8-通路和m-通路。\n连通\n若像素p和q之间存在着一条通路，则称p和q是连通的，即像素间的连通。反之，若两个像素间是连通的，那么至少存在一条通路，也可能存在多条通路。根据通路的类型，像素间的连通可分为4-连通，8-连通和m-连通。\n1.3.6图像文件格式 每一种图像文件均有一个文件头，在文件头之后是图像数据。文件头的内容一般包括文件类型、版本号、文件大小等内容。各种图像文件的制作还涉及到图像文件的压缩方式和存储效率等。常用的图像文件存储格式主要有：BMP格式、JPEG格式、GIF格式、TIFF格式等。\nBMP(bitmap)图像文件也称位图文件，其文件结构如下：\na) BITMAPFILEHEADER：BMP文件头或表头；b) BITMAPINFOHEADER：BMP文件信息头；\nc) RGBQUAD：BMP文件调色板或位图信息；d) BITMAP DATA：BMP文件数据或位图阵列；\n位图文件头长度为固定的54个字节，给出了文件的类型、大小和位图阵列的起始位置等信息。位图文件信息头基本上包含图像的所有信息，包括宽度、高度、每像素的位数、压缩方法、目标设备的水平和垂直分辨率等信息。位图文件调色板是BMP所包含的颜色表，接在BITMAPINFOHEADER结构之后含有位图中每种颜色的RGB信息。BMP文件数据是以连续行的形式存储的。\nJPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)的文件后辍名为“.jpg”或“.jpeg”。有损压缩格式，支持24位颜色，并保留照片和其他连续色调图像中存在的亮度和色相的显著和细微的变化。\nGIF (Graphics Interchange Format)的文件后缀名为“.gif”。GIF格式的特点是其在一个GIF文件中可以存多幅彩色图像，如果把存于一个文件中的多幅图像数据逐幅读出并显示到屏幕上，就可构成一种最简单的动画。\nTIFF (Tag Image File Format)的文件后缀名为“.tif”或“.tiff”。TIFF文件一般可分为文件头、参数指针表、参数数据表的偏移。参数指针表由一系列参数块构成，它们描写图像的压缩种类、长度、彩色数、扫描分辨率等许多参数。参数数据表中存放的是实际参数数据。最后一部分是图像数据。\n1.4 数字图像处理意义及内容

主要目的：\n•消除图像中无关的信息，恢复有用的真实信息。\n•增强有关信息的可检测性、最大限度地简化数据，从而改进特征提取、图像分割、匹配和识别的可靠性。\n步骤：1.灰度化 2.去噪声\n2.1 灰度化 图像灰度化的原理就是在RGB模型中，假定三个通道的值相等，然后用统一的灰度值表征该点的色彩信息，灰度值的范围是0到255。\n像素点矩阵中的每一个像素点都满足下面的关系：R=G=B，此时的这个值叫做灰度值。\n2.1.1灰度化主要方法 1）分量法：将彩色图像中的三分量RGB的亮度作为三个灰度图像的灰度值，可根据应用需要选取三种中的一种灰度图像。\n2）最大值法：将彩色图像中的三分量亮度的最大值作为灰度图的灰度值。\n3）平均值法：将彩色图像中的三分量亮度求平均得到一个灰度图。\n4）加权平均法：根据重要性及其它指标，将三个分量以不同的权值进行加权平均。\n由于人眼对绿色的敏感最高，对蓝色敏感最低。Gray=0.11B+0.59G+0.3R；OpenCV开放库所采用的灰度权值 Gray=0.072169B+0.715160G+0.212671R\n2.1.2图像二值化 p二值化通用方法：选择某个阈值T，将原始图像变为二值图像：\n当f(x,y)≥T时， f(x,y)=1\n当f(x,y) ≤T时， f(x,y)=0\n如同其他图像分割算法一样，没有一个现有方法对各种各样的图像都能得到令人满意的结果。\n几种阈值确定办法：\n1.全局二值化 目的：从多值的数字图像中直接提取出目标物体）设定一个全局的阈值T，用T将图像的数据分成两部分：大于T的像素群和小于T的像素群。将大于T的像素群的像素值设定为白色（或者黑色），小于T的像素群的像素值设定为黑色（或者白色）。\na) 取阀值为127（相当于0~255的中数），让灰度值小于等于127的变 为0（黑色），灰度值大于127的变为255（白色），这样做的好处是计算量小速度快，但是缺点也是很明显的，因为这个阀值在不同的图片中均为127，但是不同的图片，他们的颜色分布差别很大，所以用127做阀值，白菜萝卜一刀切，效果肯定是不好的。\nb)计算像素点矩阵中的所有像素点的灰度值的平均值K。然后让每一个像素点与K一 一比较，小于等于K的像素点就为0（黑色）大于K的 像素点为255（白色），这样做比方法1好一些。但是使用平均值作为二值化阈值同样有个致命的缺点，可能导致部分对象像素或者背景像素丢失。二值化结果不能真实反映源图像信息。\nc)使用直方图方法（也叫双峰法）来寻找二值化阀值直方图是图像的重要特质。直方图方法认为图像由前景和背景组成，在灰度直方图上，前景和背景都形成高峰，在双峰之间的最低，谷处就是阀值所在。取到阀值之后再一 一比较就可以了\n直方图：表示数字图像中每一灰度级像素出现的频次（该灰度级的像素数目）。\n$p(k)=n_{k }$或 $p(k)=\\frac{n_{k }}{n}$ $n_{k}$:\u0026ldquo;图像中第k个灰度级的像素总数 \u0026ldquo;，$n$:图像的像素总数\n直方图性质：1.无空间信息；2.直方图与图像一对多关系；3.可叠加性（全图与子图像）\n直方图反映了图像清晰程度。直方图均匀分布时，图像最清晰。判断一幅图像是否清晰，查看是否合理的利用了全部被允许的灰度级 一幅图像应该尽可能利用全部可能的灰度级。\n直方图也反映图像对比度和亮度。\n直方图分为四个基本类型：RGB直方图、通道直方图、明度直方图和颜色直方图。\n通道直方图：R G B通道分别画直方图。RGB直方图就是通道直方图的叠加。\n明度直方图是复合计算单个像素之后绘制的直方图，相对RGB更能反映一张照片的亮度分布趋势。\n•只有当一个像素中的R、G、B值同时为0 的时候，明度直方图的最左端才有凸起，而RGB直方图只要有任意一个像素中的任意一个R、G、B值为0，它的最左端就有凸起。\n颜色直方图，可以理解为加了颜色的RGB直方图。\nd)一种使用近似一维Means方法寻找二值化阈值：\n①初始化一个阈值T，可以自己设置或者根据随机方法生成。\n②根据阈值图将每个像素数据P(n,m)分为对象像素数据G1与背景像素数据G2。(n为行，m为列)\n③G1的平均值是m1, G2的平均值是m2\n④一个新的阈值T^′=(m1+m2)/2\n⑤回到第二步，用新的阈值继续分像素数据为对象与背景像素数据，继续2～4步，\n⑥直到计算出来的新阈值等于上一次阈值。\n2.局部二值化 全局二值化在表现图像细节方面存在很大缺陷。为了弥补这个缺陷，出现了局部二值化方法。\n•局部二值化的方法就是按照一定的规则将整幅图像**划分为N个窗口，对这N个窗口中的每一个窗口再按照一个统一的阈值$T_i$**将该窗口内的像素划分为两部分，进行二值化处理。\n3.局部自适应二值化\n局部二值化值是没有经过合理的运算得来，一般是取该窗口的平局值。这就导致在每一个窗口内仍然出现的是全局二值化的缺陷。为了解决这个问题，就出现了局部自适应二值化方法。\n•局部自适应二值化的阈值是通过对该窗口像素的平均值E，像素之间的差平方P，像素之间的均方根值Q等各种局部特征，设定一个参数方程进行阈值的计算，例如：T=a*E+b*P+c*Q，其中a,b,c是自由参数。这样得出来的二值化图像就更能表现出二值化图像中的细节。\n2.2图像噪声 •图像噪声是指存在于图像数据中的不必要的或多余的干扰信息。 图像中各种妨碍人们对其信息接受的因素即可称为图像噪声 。\n•噪声在图像上常表现为一引起较强视觉效果的孤立像素点或像素块。是图像信息或者像素亮度的随机变化。一般，噪声信号与要研究的对象不相关，它以无用的信息形式出现，扰乱图像的可观测信息。通俗的说就是噪声让图像不清楚\n来源1.图像获取过程中，图像传感器CCD和CMOS采集图像过程中受传感器材料属性、工作环境、电子元器件和电路结构等影响，会引入各种噪声2.图像信号传输过程中，传输介质和记录设备等的不完善，数字图像在其传输记录过程中往往会受到多种噪声的污染。\n影响•对于数字图像信号，噪声表为或大或小的极值，这些极值通过加减作用于图像像素的真实灰度值上，对图像造成亮、暗点干扰，极大降低了图像质量，影响图像复原、分割、特征提取、图像识别等后继工作的进行。\n脉冲噪声模型\n2.2.1分类 基于产生原因：外部噪声，即指系统外部干扰以电磁波或经电源串进系统内部而引起的噪声。如外部电气设备产生的电磁波干扰、天体放电产生的脉冲干扰等。由系统电气设备内部引起的噪声为内部噪声，如内部电路的相互干扰。内部噪声一般又可分为以下四种：(1)由光和电的基本性质所引起的噪声。(2)电器的机械运动产生的噪声。(3)器材材料本身引起的噪声。(4)系统内部设备电路所引起的噪声。\n基于噪声与信号的关系\na)加性噪声g=f+n：加性噪声和图像信号强度是不相关的和\nb)乘性嗓声g=f+fn：乘性嗓声和图像信号是相关的，往往随图像信号的变化而变化，载送每一个象素信息的载体的变化而产生的噪声受信息本身调制。在某些情况下，如信号变化很小，噪声也不大。为了分析处理方便，常常将乘性噪声近似认为是加性噪声，而且总是假定信号和噪声是互相统计独立。\n基于统计后的概率密度函数：比较重要；引入数学模型，就有助于运用数学手段去除噪声。在不同场景下噪声的施加方式都不同，由于在外界的某种条件下，噪声下图像-原图像（没有噪声时）的概率密度函数（统计结果）服从某种分布函数，就把它归类为相应的噪声。\n2.2.1.1基于统计后的概率密度函数的噪声分类及其消除方式 高斯噪声是指它的概率密度函数服从高斯分布（即正态分布）的一类噪声。如果一个噪声的幅度分布服从高斯分布，而它的功率谱密度又是均匀分布的，则称它为高斯白噪声。高斯白噪声的二阶矩不相关，一阶矩为常数，是指先后信号在时间上的相关性。\n其中x表示灰度值，μ表示x的平均值或期望值，σ表示x的标准差。\n•产生原因：a)电路各元器图像传感器在拍摄时市场不够明亮、亮度不够均匀；b)件自身噪声和相互影响；\nc)图像传感器长期工作，温度过高。\n•噪声对原图像的影响是随机的，直方图呈现的分布形式是基于统计的结果。直方图表示了（归一化后）灰度值的概率密度分布，因此可以使用直方图来表示灰度值的概率密度。\n瑞利噪声伽马（爱尔兰）噪声，其中 α称为形状参数（shape parameter），主要决定了分布曲线的形状，而 β称为 rate parameter（或叫 inverse scale parameter， 1/β称为scale parameter），主要决定曲线有多陡。\n脉冲（椒盐）噪声 一种随机出现的白点或者黑点，可能是亮的区域有黑色像素或是在暗的区域有白色像素（或是两者皆有）。成因可能是影像讯号受到突如其来的强烈干扰而产生、类比数位转换器或位元传输错误等。例如失效的感应器导致像素值为最小值，饱和的感应器导致像素值为最大值。\n如果b\u0026gt;a，灰度值b在图像中将显示为一个亮点，相反，a的值将显示为一个暗点。若Pa或Pb为零，则脉冲噪声称为单极脉冲。如果Pa和Pb均不可能为零，尤其是它们近似相等时，脉冲噪声值将类似于随机分布在图像上的胡椒和盐粉微粒。由于这个原因，双极脉冲噪声也称为椒盐噪声。同时，它们有时也称为散粒和尖峰噪声。\n椒盐噪声是惟一一种引起退化的视觉可见的噪声类型。其他的虽然直方图相似但也很难看出区别。\n直方图和概率密度函数有对应关系。\n2.2.2图像过滤噪声 空间域滤波 频率域滤波 形态学运算 空间域滤波是指直接通过原图像中像素点的灰度值进行数据运算去除噪声的方法,常见的空间域滤波方法主要有均值滤波、中值滤波、高斯低通滤波等；\n//线性 非线性 fo(x,y)= T[ fi(x,y) ]，T是线性/非线性算子\n中值滤波器 非线性平滑滤波器，将图像中以某像素点为中心的窗口范围内的所有像素点的灰度值(包括该中心像素点)进行排序,然后将灰度序列的中间值赋给该中心像素点。\n其他线性滤波考量每个像素，中值滤波会忽略那些相对邻域(此处设为n*n窗口)内大部分像素点而言,亮度偏暗或偏亮,且所占区域小于总像素点一半(即n/2)的像素点的影响,从而有效滤除孤立的噪声点。\n中值滤波法对于某些类型的随机噪声，如图像扫描噪声等等，具有良好的去噪效果，特别是在滤除噪声的同时，能够保护信号的边缘，使之不被模糊。这些优良特性是线性滤波方法所不具有的。中值滤波的算法比较简单，也易于用硬件实现。\n超限中值滤波法 相对中值滤波保留图像细节\n•基于个数的中值滤波法：通过设定阈值T限制邻域内像素点与中心像素点灰度差绝对值的范围，从而将含噪图像中的像素点的属性划分为平坦区域、图像边缘、噪点三类。\n均值滤波/邻域平均法 线性滤波算法，它是指在图像上对目标像素给一个模板，该模板包括了其周围的临近像素（以目标象素为中心的周围8个像素，构成一个滤波模板，即去掉目标像素本身），再用模板中的全体像素的平均值来代替原来像素值。\n对噪声图像特别是有大的孤立点的图像非常敏感，即使有极少数量点存在较大差异也会导致平均值的明显波动。不能很好地保护图像细节，在图像去噪的同时也破坏了图像的细节部分，从而使图像变得模糊，模糊程度与邻域半径成正比不能很好地去除噪声点。特别是椒盐噪声。\n超限邻域平均法 如果某个像素的灰度值大于其邻域像素的平均值，且达到了一定水平，则判断该像素为噪声，继而用邻域像素的均值取代这一像素值\n一般的,“超限邻域平均法”比一般邻域平均法的效果要好\n在操作中对窗口的大小及门限的选择要慎重，T太小，噪声消除不干净；T太大，易使图像模糊\n在实际应用中一般选用3×3窗口加权均值滤波器\n高斯滤波 1、定义 线性滤波器，适用于消除高斯噪声，广泛应用于图像处理的减噪过程。\n2、作用原理 和均值滤波器类似，用一个模板（或称卷积、掩模）扫描图像中的每一个像素，用模板确定的邻域内像素的加权平均灰度值去替代模板中心像素点的值。\n3、系数特征 均值滤波器的模板系数都是1；而高斯滤波器的模板系数，则随着距离模板中心的增大而系数减小（高斯分布）。所以，高斯滤波器相比于均值滤波器对图像个模糊程度较小。\n卷积核：高斯核 理论上，高斯分布在所有定义域上都有非负值，这就需要一个无限大的卷积核。实际上，仅需要取均值周围3倍标准差内的值，以外部份直接去掉即可。\n4、真实图像在空间内的像素是缓慢变化的，因此临近点的像素变化不会很明显，所以高斯滤波在保留信号的条件下减少噪声。这种方法在接近边缘处无效，因此高斯滤波会破平边缘。但是，高斯平滑滤波器对于抑制服从正态分布的噪声仍非常有效。\n5、性质 （1）二维高斯函数具有旋转对称性，即滤波器在各个方向上的平滑程度相同一般来说，一幅图像的边缘方向是事先不知道的，因此，在滤波前是无法确定一个方向上比另一方向上需要更多的平滑．旋转对称性意味着高斯平滑滤波器在后续边缘检测中不会偏向任一方向（2）高斯函数是单值函数，高斯滤波器用像素邻域的加权均值来代替该点的像素值，而每一邻域像素点权值是随该点与中心点的距离单调增减的（3）高斯函数的傅立叶变换频谱是单瓣的；既能保留低频分量，又能保留高频分量，因此能比较好地保留图像的低频和高频信息，并在保留图像信息和滤出噪声之间找到一个平衡点。（4）高斯滤波器宽度(决定着平滑程度)是由参数σ表征的。σ越大，高斯滤波器的频带就越宽，平滑程度就越好。通过调节平滑程度参数σ，可在图像特征过分模糊(过平滑)与平滑图像中由于噪声和细纹理所引起的过多的不希望突变量(欠平滑)之间取得折衷（5）由于高斯函数的可分离性，较大尺寸的高斯滤波器可以得以有效地实现．二维高斯函数卷积可以分两步来进行，首先将图像与一维高斯函数进行卷积，然后将卷积结果与方向垂直的相同一维高斯函数卷积．因此，二维高斯滤波的计算量随滤波模板宽度成线性增长而不是成平方增长．\n6、特征\n1)一个高斯函数跟另外一个高斯函数的卷积仍然是一个高斯函数，A*B=C C的标准差的平方是A和B的标准差的平方和，也就是说卷积后的高斯函数更宽，模糊的效果更明显（直观上看，连续做高斯模糊运算，图像会越来越模糊） 2)高斯函数的傅立叶变换仍然是一个高斯函数，如果原来的高斯函数越宽（标准差越大），变换后的高斯函数就越窄（标准差越小），也就是说一个越宽的高斯函数，低通（高阻）滤波的效果越明显，处理后的图像的细节就越不清楚（更模糊）\n\r第三章 图像增强 3.1 图像增强概述 3.1.1 定义 图像增强(Image enhancement)是图像处理的基本内容之一。图像增强是指按特定的需要突出一幅图像中的某些信息，同时，削弱(weaken)或去除(eliminate)某些不需要的信息。这类处理是为了某种应用目的去改善图像质量，处理的结果更适合于人的视觉特性或机器识别系统。增强处理并不能增加原始图像的信息，而只能增强对某种信息的辨识能力，并且这种处理有可能损失一些其它信息。\n3.1.2 应用 第一类是改善图像的视觉效果；第二是突出图像的特征，便于计算机处理\n图像在生成、获取、传输等过程中,往往会发生质量的损伤，造成图像质量的损坏的因素有： 图像传输等过程中,由于信道带宽的限制所造成的图像模糊；图像中的噪声干扰 信号减弱，对比度下降；成象条件的欠缺，获取图像的清晰度偏低\n图像质量退化的原因 对比度问题：对比度局部或全部偏低,影响图像视觉 噪声干扰问题：使图像蒙受干扰和破坏 清晰度下降问题,使图像模糊不清,甚至严重失真\n图像增强并不去估计图像实际退化的过程和实际退化的因素而加以矫正，而只考虑图像退化的一般性质，加以修正，以求得一般的或平均地图像质量的改进。例如，边缘锐化去模糊、平滑去噪声、直方图修正对比度增强等\n3.2 图像增强方法 3.3 灰度变换/点运算 空间域处理 $g(x,y)=T[f(x,y)]$\n当每次处理只基于一点 $s=T(r)$，$s,r$为该点像素值——点运算\n应用场景：曝光不足或过度，或由于成像设备的非线性和图像记录设备动态范围太窄等因素，会产生对比度不足的弊病，使图像中的细节分辨不清可以使用灰度变换方法解决这些问题\n灰度变换定义：将一个灰度区间映射到另一个灰度区间的变换称为灰度变换\n在图像增强方面的作用：使图像动态范围加大，图像对比度扩展，图像清晰，特征明显\n灰度级变换的应用：亮度调整——加亮、减暗图像；对比度拉伸——提高、降低对比度；灰度级切片，主要用于突出某个特定的灰度范围，从而增强某个专门的特征\n3.3.1线性灰度变换

高比特平面包含视觉上重要的大多数数据；低比特平面贡献更精细的灰度细节。\n分层方式：灰度信息由n个比特位存储的图像，根据每个二进制位的取值(0/1)得到n个层；其实就是将比特深度将图像矩阵“切开”\n3.3.3 非线性灰度变换 指数函数变换 对数函数变换

直方图只包含概率，丢失了位置信息。 2.图像与直方图是多对一的映射关系。3. 一幅图像各子区的直方图之和就等于该图全图的直方图。\n直方图修正：通过灰度映射函数，$G_{new}=T(G_{old})$将原灰度直方图改造成所希望的直方图。\n3.4.2 直方图均衡化

边缘检测的算法主要是基于图像强度的一阶和二阶导数，导数对噪声很敏感，因此必须采用滤波器来改善。主要有高斯滤波，采用离散化的高斯函数产生一组归一化的高斯核，然后基于高斯核函数对图像灰度矩阵的每一个点进行加权求和。 2、增强 增强边缘的基础是确定图像各点邻域强度的变化值。增强算法可以将图像灰度点邻域强度值有显著变化的点凸显出来，通过计算梯度幅值来确定 。通常我们用小区域模板进行卷积来计算，有 Sobel 算子、 Roberts 算子、 Prewitt 算子等。 3、检测 经过增强的图像，往往邻域中有很多点的梯度值比较大，所以采用某种方法对这些点进行取舍， 常\n6.3 阈值分割法 阈值分割是直接对灰度图进行计算的分割方法。\n6.3.1 阈值分割原理   通式$g(x,y)=\\begin{cases} \u0026amp;Z_E ,\\ f(x,y)∈Z\\ \u0026amp;

目标和背景的对比度随着位置的不同可能有较大变化(比如光照不均)。   单阈值 图像中只有单个目标和单个背景的情况，或者只对图像进行简单的划分。   多阈值 图像中存在多个目标或多个背景的情形，或者对图像进行多个层次的划分。   直接阈值 对比度较大的图像，图像中在区域内部灰度基本一致，而不同区域之间灰度有较大的差异。   间接阈值 图像中的目标和背景差别不是很大，如果不作处理直接选取阈值的话，用这个阈值不能很好地分割图像。    6.3.2 阈值处理 6.3.2.1 基本全局阈值处理 1、为全局阈值T选取一个初始估计值\n2、分割图像。产生两组像素G1和G2\n3、对G1和G2中的像素分别计算平均灰度值（均值）m1和m2\n4、在m1和m2之间计算新的阈值

基本思想：经过适当的阈值化的两个类，就其像素灰度值而言，应当是截然不同的。同理，就其灰度值而言，给出最佳类间分离的阈值将是最佳的阈值。\n求解过程不需要人为设定其他参数，完全由计算机自动选取。它不仅适用于两个区域的分割，也可以推广到多个区域的情形。\nOtus算法实现流程  计算输入图像（大小MxN，有L个不同灰度级[0, 1, 2, \u0026hellip;,

由于$P_1(k),m(k),\\sigma^2_G$均为累加值，可以在遍历各个灰度级的同时进行递推计算，即$P_1(k)=P_1(k-1)+p_{k},k=0,1,2,\u0026hellip;,L-1$，其中$P_1(-1)$记为0。\nOtus方法类间方差公式推导

The findings are intended to inform the design of a robotic controller that delivers pulses of torque to the lower extremity joints with optimal timing and amplitude to induce desirable modulations of GS and SL, and of associated spatiotemporal parameters.\nConcepts sagittal plane矢状面，把身体分成左右两条，解剖学用来描述身体各部分位置（类似经线）N.B.不只有中线\nsagittal plane movement包括任何具有前后成分的运动\nNotations   GS: gait speed\n  TLA: trailing limb angle\n  SL: stride length\n  SL for cycle k was defined based on the right heel strike time t and anteroposterior coordinate in the laboratory frame x and constant velocity of the treadmill v\n$SL_{(k)}=x_{(k+1)}-x_{(k)}+v(t_{(k+1)}-t_{(k)})$\n    $L_l$: leg length in m\n  $\\alpha_l$: time of application(defined as the set of integers between 5% and 95%, providing a quantization in the time of application of torque pulses equal to 1% of a gait cycle duration)\n  $A_l$: amplitude\n  $\\tau(\\overset{\\sim}t)$ : an average hip, knee, and ankle joint moment profile(力矩); Segmented gait cycles linearly resampled in the [0, 100] % gait cycle domain $\\overset{\\sim}t$ and averaged at each point in gait cycle to yield $\\tau(\\overset{\\sim}t)$\n  $\\overset{\\sim}\\tau$/$\\overset{-}\\tau$: normalized joint moments.\n  Background   gait training devices\n  that promote desired changes in gait\n  Challenges in developing such devices: limited understanding of human response to robotic input\n 比如机器人运动辅助会怎样影响gait speed    Possible method of controller formulation: control robot to apply the change in joint moment applied by human subjects when they achieve a gait feature of interest.\n  However, it is currently unclear how lower extremity joint moments are modulated by even basic gait spatio-temporal parameters.\n    GS $\\leftrightarrow$ propulsive force + Propulsive impulse $\\leftrightarrow$ TLA $\\Rightarrow$ GS $\\leftrightarrow$ TLA\nGS correlated with anterior- posterior ground reaction force(the propulsive force of the foot against the ground)1\nPropulsive impulse冲量(the propulsive force integrated over time), is associated with the posture of the trailing limb at push-off.2 The posture of the trailing limb at push-off is quantified by one kinematic parameter, known as trailing limb angle (TLA), defined as the angle of the line connecting the hip joint center and foot center of pressure at the instant of peak propulsive force, relative to the global vertical axis最大推进力瞬时髋与足中心连线与竖直方向的夹角\nWhen increasing GS, the increase in TLA contributes twice as much as the increase in ankle moment to the resulting increase in propulsive force. In older adults exposed to a biofeedback paradigm for increasing propulsive force, increased TLA and decreased hip flexor power were the primary means by which they increased propulsive force.\n  A possible method of controller formulation can be derived from the principle of bio-inspiration, where a robot is controlled to apply the difference in joint moment applied by human subjects when they achieve a desired gait feature (in this case modulation of TLA), relative to their normal walking condition. 控制思路：检测TLA变化，根据正常行走时的关系调整辅助系统的关节运动\n  Since TLA has not been a primary measure ofinterest in the biome- chanics literature, we extended our search to a more common variable, likely correlated to TLA, such as stride length (SL).\n  GS modulation和magnitude of peak joint moments的关系研究得比较多，hip knee ankle和变化的先后关系、出现的phase等；However, fewer investigations have focused on the joint kinetics associated with the modulation of spatiotemporal parameters such as SL or TLA, and studied this effect at multiple GS values.又列举了一些证明SL和关节动力学有关的研究；Thus far, the factorial modulation ofboth GS and SL and resulting hip, knee, and ankle kinetics has not been investigated; as such it is unclear how lower extremity joint moments are modulated by both gait parameters.\n  Materials and Methods  准备：跑步机；36 reflective spherical markers (4 on the pelvis, 4 per thigh, 4 per shank, 2 per knee, and 6 on ankle/foot；摄像头动捕；Marker data were acquired at 100 Hz, while the treadmill analog force/torque data were acquired at 2 kHz；biofeedback 显示当前SL使被试进行调整 采样（GS 5 * SL 3 = 15种场景）：1️⃣ calculate the subject’s self-selected gait speed (ss-GS) 2️⃣ Non-biofeedback conditions: calculate ss-SL at five speeds (ss-GS [80%, 90%, 100%, 110%, 120%] in random order) 3️⃣ Biofeedback conditions: 被试根据跑步机的SL反馈分别用 1+17% / 1-17% 的ss-SL 数据分析  Data analysis 1. 数据处理 1️⃣ 25N门控处理力 2️⃣ 低通滤波处理动捕和力（cut-off currency分别6Hz 30Hz）3️⃣ 插值处理动捕数据（a third order polynomial fit for a maximum gap size of five samples三阶多项式拟合）4️⃣ 将受试者的质量、身高和站立校准标记位置应用到解剖模板中，得到一个7节段(骨盆、大腿、小腿和脚)受试者模型\n(a) In a custom MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) script, hip, knee, and ankle joint angles and moments for the right leg in the sagittal plane were extracted and filtered with a 2nd order low-pass zero-shift Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 15 Hz.\n(b) Gait cycles were segmented between subsequent heel strike events, defined as the instants at which the vertical ground reaction force changed in value from zero to positive, and remained positive for a minimum of 400ms. 手动检查排除由于仪器故障/被试踏空导致的异常数据； A minimum of 25 segmented gait cycles were linearly resampled in the [0, 100] % gait cycle domain $\\overset{\\sim}t$ and averaged at each point in gait cycle to yield an average hip, knee, and ankle joint moment profile $\\tau(\\overset{\\sim}t)$ for each of the 15 experimental conditions for each of the 20 subjects\n(c) the non-dimensional无量纲 joint moment $\\overset{\\sim}\\tau$ was calculated for each joint as $\\overset{\\sim}\\tau(\\overset{\\sim}t)=\\frac{\\tau(\\overset{-}t)}{WL_l}$ , where W is body weight in N, and $L_l$ leg length in m, measured as the distance between the hip joint center and the floor during straight-leg standing.\n2.

Arrow denotes increasing values for each direction. Horizontal axis represents the gait cycle time scale.\nMotion Data Interpretation The minimum information available from a motion record is the magnitude of the peak angles (high and low) experienced by the joint being studied.\n通过峰值划分motion，和正常状态下相比较（1️⃣magnitudes of joint motion 2️⃣ timing of the action 3️⃣ coordinating the motion patterns of the adjacent joints）\nDynamic Electromyography 肌肉控制与动态肌电图 EMG Quantification 肌电图量化 Manual (or descriptive); Electronic summation of the EMG signals; Computer quantification\n采样频率2500Hz 但数据过多，一般取1000或500Hz\n数字化，对信号进行全波整流（避免正负值在后续处理中相互抵消。整流包括将所有的负信号转置到零线的正侧）\n在一个适合的时间间隔进行累加；0.01秒interval(大约1% GC)被发现是最好的;3% interval: less variability in the EMG wave\n归一化技术：将每个电极的功能数据作为参考值将同一电极产生的值转化为比率(通常以百分比表示)。\nadjusting the onset and cessation times of the individual quantified records to match the mean timing.\nEMG Interpretation timing与运动相 phases有关 用于判断当前运动状态\nRelative Effort 运动越用力，振幅变大，图形密集\nEMG和force相互推导\nGround Reaction Force and Vector Analysis 步态动力学——地反力、向量、力矩、功率和压力 ground reaction forces (GRF)\nVertical Load Characteristics Normal stance phase pattern of vertical forces generated by the customary walking speed of 82m/ min has two peaks separated by a valley.\nThe force on the force plate changes with changing vertical acceleration.\n峰值值约为体重的110%，而谷值力约为体重的80%。第一个峰(F1)发生在MS的开始，此时身体的重心正在迅速下降。在MS后期，谷值(F2)是由身体向前滚过静止的脚时重心上升造成的。第二个峰值(F3)出现在TS后期，再次表明身体重心向前落在TS的前足上时重心下降。\nVertical force \u0026amp; Speed v减小，峰谷更平坦，反之亦然。\nThe magnitude of the vertical force changes with variations in gait speed. Walking at slower speeds (\u0026lt;60m/min) reduces the momentum, and therefore the vertical acceleration, with a corresponding decrease in both the peaks and valley deviations from body weight.\nConversely, fast walking speeds induce higher peaks and lower valleys. Running registers peaks 2.5 times body weight.\nHorizontal Shear The forces generated parallel to the wa1king surface are called shear.\nHorizontal forces in the anterior-posterior (AP) plane: the ground reaction force vector deviates from the vertical.\nHorizontal medial-lateral (ML 内侧 外侧 ) shear forces: the exchange of body weight from one limb to the\nML force is least, being less than 10% of body weight. Peak medial shear (5% BW) occurs in mid loading response. Lateral shear reaches a peak (7% BW) in terminal stance.\nThe AP shear force (also called fore-aft forces) is equivalent to less than 25%of body weight. At initial contact there often is a momentary aft shear (13% BW).\nLoading the limb rapidly introduces an anteriorly directed force, which reaches a peak (13% BW) at the end of the loading response phase. This is not sustained.\nMid stance is an interval with minimal sagittal shear until just before heel rise, when a posterior shear begins. There is a rapid rise in the posterior force throughout terminal stance, with a final peak equaling 23%BW.\n⬆️ Normal ground reaction force pattern during stance. (a) Vertical force; (b) Lateral shear (horizontal); (c) Progressional shear (horizontal fore/aft).\nVectors Joint Torques Torque is defined as the product of the force and its lever arm T = FxL. The lever (or moment arm) for the joint torque presented by the body\u0026rsquo;s posture is the perpendicular distance between the line of action of the vector and the center of the joint. The vertical ground reaction is the determining force in stance. By combining motion and vector data the torques occurring throughout the stride can be calculated. Sagittal plane data define the flexion and extension torques. Coronal plane measurements identify the abduction and adduction demands. Transverse moments (torques) are calculated by combin­ing the fore-aft and mediolateral values. Calculation of joint torques from the vector and motion data, as just described, is technically easier, but the effects of gravity and inertia are not included. Studies comparing moment calculations with and without consider­ing the gravitational and inertial factors have shown no difference in the ankle data, but at the hip and knee there were intervals in the gait cycle where the simple vector data registered higher values The investigators have differed on the significance of these findings. Bressler and Frankel noted a brief increase in both the knee and hip values at the beginning loading response of approximately 20% and a similar difference in terminal stance for the hip. Mikosz et al noted the exaggeration of the sagittal knee and hip torques (expressed in units of percent body weight X stature) was 1 % each. These two groups of authors concluded that for most situations, use of the unmodified vector data was adequate. Wells , in contrast, felt the omission of the While very significant for understanding the logic of muscular action, the resulting numbers tend to be too abstract for most clinicians.\n自重会带来影响但部分研究人员认为可以忽略。\nCenter of Pressure C/P base of the GRF vector lies within the foot, as that is the body segment in contact with the floor.\nWhile the word pressure is in common use, it is not correct, as the area of contact is not considered in the calculation. Center of support would be more accurate.\nEach C/P point represents the mean of the vertical forces on the four instrumented supporting posts of the force plate. By also defining the location of the foot on the force plate, an anatomical correlation can be made. The center of pressure is related to the plantar outline of the foot, but its location does not necessarily identify that portion of the foot receiving the greatest pressure. Only during the period of isolated heel support in loading response or the forefoot support interval in terminal stance will the C/P have any anatomical significance. Even then, the C/ P point represents an average of all the forces on either the heel or forefoot, not the site of maximum pressure.\nThe C/P is located in an anatomical area that makes little or no contact with the floor. C/P位于一个解剖区域，很少或没有接触地板。\nIntrinsic Foot Pressure To determine the pressures experienced by the different structures within the foot\nStride Characteristics 步幅分析 The natural mix of joint mobility, muscle strength, neural control and energy leads to a customary walk­ing speed, stride length and step rate. These time and distance factors, in combination with the swing and stance times, constitute the person\u0026rsquo;s stride characteristics.\nNormal persons, while able to voluntarily modify their gait velocity as needed, also have a spontaneous rate that is called either free or customary walking speed (CWS). This free rate of travel designates the optimum functional balance of the person\u0026rsquo;s physical qualities.\nVelocity = Stride Length x 0.5 Cadence Cadence (step rate)\nNormal Variability Normal adults show a moderate variability in their free walking velocity. One group of 60 subjects ages 20 to 65 years showed a 7% standard deviation during indoor testing following pretraining to a common cadence. Another 111 persons ages 20 to 80 tested on an outdoor track displayed a 4% deviation. Two identifiable sources of this variability are age and height (or limb length). Age\n A notable difference in velocity (14%) when arthritis and other disabilities are allowed as natural events. With healthy subjects the influence of age is less, but increases as years beyond 65 are added. The decrease in mean velocity was just 3% for a 60- to 65-year-old group. This increased to 9% when the study group included ages 60 to 80; significant decline in walking ability began after age 70 years.  Limb Length 儿童中显著；成人腿长与步幅相关性不强($r^2$ = 0.21 ~ 0.28)\nVoluntary Variability Normal persons have a wide range of safe and relatively comfortable walking speeds.\nthe changes in stride length and cadence were about equal. (of similar percentage)\nThe standard deviations for normal free walking is approximately 10% of the mean value. The preceding data indicate 4% of this deviation is related to leg length. Age has no significance until the person is past 60 years. Thus, the larger factor appears to be spontaneous variability.\nEnergy Cost 能量消耗 与实验无关，暂略\n  J. Perry, J.M.

Gait Analysis: three basic approaches3 The simplest system subdivides the cycle accord­ing to the variations in reciprocal floor contact by the two feet. A second method uses the time and distance qualities of the stride. The third approach identifies the functional significance of the events within the gait cycle and designates these intervals as the functional phases of gait.\nGait cycle (GC) One gait cycle (a single sequence of these functions by one limb) can be divided into two phases, stance (ST) and swing (SW), which can be subdivided into 5 and 3 phases, respectively.\nStance is the term used to designate the entire period during which the foot is on the ground. Stance begins with initial contact.\n  IC initial contact 对于没有某一类型行走障碍的人来说就是 HS heel strike.\n  Subdivided into 3 intervals according to the sequence of floor contact by the two feet. (根据两腿所在的运动相划分，与phase不同)\n Both the start and end of stance involve a period of bilateral foot contact with the floor (double stance; term \u0026ldquo;support\u0026rdquo; is avoided for an unequal sharing of body weight by the two feet), while the middle portion of stance has one foot contact. Initial double stance/Loading response(10%) begins the gait cycle. It is the time both feet are on the floor after IC. Single limb support(40%) begins when the opposite foot is lifted for swing. (所以Swing和Single limb support占比相同) Terminal double stance(10%) begins with floor contact by the other foot (contralateral initial contact) and continues until the original stance limb is lifted for swing (ipsilateral toe-off).    Swing applies to the time the foot is in the air for limb advancement. Swing begins as the foot is lifted from the floor (toe-off).\nGait Cycle ＆ Speed   total stance and swing times和速度负相关；The change in stance and swing times becomes progressively greater as speed slows.\n  Subdivisions of stance : 速度与Single stance interval/Swing占比正相关；curvilinear pattern of change.\n  Having an interval when both feet are in contact with the ground for the limbs to exchange their support roles is a basic characteristic of walking. When double stance is omitted, the person has entered the running mode of locomotion.\nStride and Step Stride is the equivalent of a gait cycle. It is based on the actions of one limb.The duration of a stride is the interval between two sequential initial floor contacts by the same limb (i.e., right IC and the next right IC).\nStep refers to the timing between the two limbs. There are two steps in each stride (or gait cycle). At the midpoint of one stride the other foot contacts the ground to begin its next stance period. The interval between an initial contact by each foot is a step (i.e., left and then right). The same offset in timing will be repeated in reciprocal fashion throughout the walk.\nGait Phases Gait events  IC Initial contact 对于没有某一类型行走障碍的人来说就是 HS heel strike. OT Opposite toe off HO/HR Heel rise/off OI Opposite initial contact TO Toe off FA Feet adjacent TV Tibia vertical  \u0026hellip;(FO foot off, FF foot flat)\nTasks The phases of gait also provide a means for correlating the simultaneous actions of the individual joints into patterns of total limb function. 联系关节模式和运动\n Each of the eight gait phases has a functional objective and a critical pattern of selective synergistic motion to accomplish this goal.\n Weight acceptance (WA) begins the stance period and uses the first two gait phases (IC initial contact and LR loading response).\nSingle limb support (SLS) continues stance with the next two phases of gait (MSt mid stance and TSt terminal stance).\nLimb advancement(LA) begins in the final phase of stance (pre-swing) and then continues through the three phases of swing (ISw initial swing,MSw midswing and TSw terminal swing).\n7 gait phases    Stance Swing     Loading response\nMid-stanceTerminal stancePre-swing Initial swingMid-swingTerminal swing       Phase Term Interval Figure(the reference limb shaded) Beginning \u0026amp; ending events Phase of the other leg movements of joints     0 Initial Contact (IC) 0-2%  / end of TSt hip flexed; knee extended; ankle dorsiflexed to neutral.   1 Loading response (LR) 0-10%  IC \u0026amp; (contralateral)TO/OT PSw knee flexed with the heel as a rocker for shock absorption.
