      <description>Detection of gait events using an F-Scan in-shoe pressure measurement system  对F-Scan® system准确性的讨论 Methods &amp;amp; Results   KT的阈值选取 一些验证指标  Detection of gait events using an F-Scan in-shoe pressure measurement system 比较了force-based detection (FD，软件自带)和area-based method (AD) ；kinetic detection(KT，使用force platforms的数据)作为validation
对F-Scan® system准确性的讨论 Several studies have evaluated the accuracy and reliability of force and pressure measurements using the F-Scan® system and reached different conclusions. While some authors concluded that F-Scan demonstrated good to excellent reliability in measuring plantar pressures [11], others concluded that the system was not entirely suitable for accurate and repeatable absolute pressure measurements [12], [13], [14] or that the system could be used only in a sample large enough as to allow the detection of the real effect of the treatment [15].</description>
