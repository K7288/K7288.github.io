      <description>Intention Recognition in Physical Human-Robot Interaction Based on Radial Basis Function Neural Network
Research question a method based on radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model is presented to identify the motion intention of collaborator.
Here, the human intention is defined as the desired velocity in human limb model, of which the estimation is obtained in real time based on interaction force and the contact point movement characteristics (current position and velocity of the robot) by the trained RBFNN model.</description>
