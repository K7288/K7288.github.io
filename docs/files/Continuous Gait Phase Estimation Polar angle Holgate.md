Tibia angular velocity multiplied by a scaling factor versus tibia angle. The closer the curve is to the origin, the shorter the stride length. Polar angle $\Phi$ represents the progression around the curve based on gait percent. $r$ is the polar radius and is related to the stride length of the particular curve.

Tibia angle profile for able bodied human gait. Each curve represents a different stride length. The closer the curve is to the zero degree axis, the shorter the stride length.
